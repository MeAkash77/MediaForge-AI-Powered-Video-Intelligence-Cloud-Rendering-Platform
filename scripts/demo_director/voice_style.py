"""Voice personality / speech-markup layer for the series narrator.

This is the single place where WRITTEN script text becomes SPOKEN text, per
engine — the seed of a system-wide "Voice Personality" layer holding terms,
pacing and pronunciation under one controllable structure.

Engine control surfaces (researched + verified empirically 2026-08-13):

  kokoro (misaki G2P frontend)
    - Inline phoneme override: [word](/ipa/) — misaki's custom IPA variant;
      unknown symbols are SILENTLY DROPPED, so verify every new override by
      whisper-transcribing a sample (see MASTER_TASKS walkthrough entry).
    - Pauses come from PUNCTUATION ONLY (no SSML): periods and commas pause;
      em-dashes read as a beat. Letter-spaced acronyms ("G P U") DESTROY
      sentence pauses — whisper heard "GP You Know cloud". All-caps acronyms
      (GPU, AI, PNG, MP3, CSV, API, LLM, VRAM, RAM, URL, TTS) are handled
      natively: correct letters, correct pauses. Write them plainly.
    - Verified: [Guaardvark](/ɡˈɑɹdvɑɹk/) → "GuardVark" (hard G kept);
      the "Guard-vark" respelling degrades to "gard-vark".

  piper / chatterbox
    - No inline phoneme syntax. Letter-spaced acronyms ("G P U") and
      respellings ("Guard-vark") remain the right tools there.
