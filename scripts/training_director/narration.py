"""Narration for training videos.

Synthesizes a trainer's voice from a reference clip via Chatterbox
(audio_foundry `/generate/voice`), verifies every line against the script with
whisper, and assembles takes into one WAV with constructed silence between
lines.

The narrator's clip, delivery preset and trade vocabulary come from the active
project; endpoints come from the environment. Only the audio half of the
walkthrough harness (`scripts/demo_director/`) is carried over — there is no
screen capture here.
