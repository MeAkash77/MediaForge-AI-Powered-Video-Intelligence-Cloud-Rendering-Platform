"""Character Designer — the "Casting Director" appearance-bible role.

The internal term for this is the **Casting Director**: it writes a very comprehensive,
detail-locked description of a character (down to the mole on a cheek) and a
reference-sheet of angle/expression prompts to generate synthetic LoRA training
data with FLUX.

NAMING: there is already a `CastingDirector` agent (`casting_director.py`) doing
*production casting* (which existing actors to cast + voices, deliberately
orphaned so it can't auto-trigger GPU training). This module is the DIFFERENT
role — designing a NEW character's look. Kept separate to avoid clobbering it.
UI label stays "Casting Director".

DESIGN (empirically verified 2026-06-21, gemma4:12b, format=json): a single call
asking for {bible, trigger, N fully-populated shots} is unreliable — the model
drops a field ~every gen at N>=4, the JSON goes malformed ~N>=8, and it paraphrases
the bible per shot instead of echoing it verbatim. The *content* is excellent. So
we split into two SMALL, reliable agents and let `character_generator_service`
orchestrate (bible-first → batched shots → compose prompts in code):

  - BibleDesigner: one tiny call → the frozen identity bible + a fabricated trigger.
  - ShotDesigner:  a batch of VARIATION descriptors (angle/expression/lighting/scene)
                   for a set of requested angle slots — it does NOT re-describe the
                   face. The service composes `trigger + verbatim bible + variation`.

All fields are lenient (defaults) so one dropped field degrades instead of failing,
per the never-raise BaseSwarmAgent contract.

appearance for use as a FLUX image-generation reference (FLUX's text encoder is T5, so it wants
rich NATURAL-LANGUAGE description, not tags).

Do two things and nothing else:

1. Write a CHARACTER BIBLE: ONE dense paragraph fixing every INVARIANT identity feature so the
   same person is recognizable from any angle. Be specific and physical: face shape, jawline,
   skin tone/texture, distinguishing marks (moles/scars/freckles and their EXACT placement),
   eye color/shape, eyebrows, nose, lips, hair color/length/style, build, age, default wardrobe.
   Describe ONLY fixed identity — no camera angle, no pose, no lighting, no background.

2. Invent a TRIGGER WORD: a short rare FABRICATED token that is NOT a real name or dictionary
   word (e.g. "xvlr", "qttn", "zdrk"), so it won't collide with concepts the model already knows.

Return ONLY this JSON (no prose, no markdown):
